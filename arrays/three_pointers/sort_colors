Question:
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Solution: Can be solved using 'Dutch National Flag Algorithm'

class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length-1;

        while(mid<=high){
            if(nums[mid] == 0){
                int temp = nums[mid];
                nums[mid] = nums[low];
                nums[low] = temp;

                low++;
                mid++;
            }else if(nums[mid] == 1){
                mid++;
            }else{
                int temp = nums[high];
                nums[high] = nums[mid];
                nums[mid] = temp;

                high--;
            }
        }
    }
}
