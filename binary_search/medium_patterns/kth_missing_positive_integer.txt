Question:
Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.
Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int start = 0, end = n-1, missing = 0;
        while(start <= end){
            int mid = (start + end)/2;
            missing = arr[mid] - mid;
            if(missing <= k){
                start = mid+1;
            }else{
                end = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return k+end+1;
    }
}
